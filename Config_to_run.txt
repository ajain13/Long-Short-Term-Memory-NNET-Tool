Note: Data is from the following link - find attached 

The one we used today was sample data not forex.


Configurations to run

Baseline to compare all is the standard setting given by
(we set adam because all its default values are set including learning rate)

no: layers 3
layer dimensions 1 4 1
optimiser - adam
learning rate - default
momentum - default
error - rmse

Variation with number of nodes in default settings

A) Single hidden layer - we will just vary no: of units - simple network

1.  3, 1 6 1, adam, default, default, rmse
2. 3, 1 8 1, adam, default, default, rmse
3. 3, 1 10 1 adam, default, default,rmse

vary units from 5-20 and lets see if we can get a good fit.


Variation with number of layer 

1. 3, 1 best value from A 1 adam, default, default,rmse
2. 4, 1 best value from A 1 adam, default,default,rmse
3. 5, 1 best value from A ... 1 adam, default, default, rmse
